# Background and requirements
Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that was created in 2009 by an individual or group of individuals using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. It operates on a peer-to-peer network, allowing for the direct transfer of funds without the need for intermediaries like banks. Transactions are recorded on a public ledger known as the blockchain, which is maintained by a network of users called "miners." Since its creation, Bitcoin has experienced significant growth in popularity and value. Initially, the value of a single Bitcoin was only a few cents, but by December 2017, it reached an all-time high of nearly $20,000. Despite experiencing a significant drop in value in the following months, Bitcoin has since regained much of its value and has become a widely recognized and accepted form of currency.
One of the key drivers of Bitcoin's growth has been the use of social media. Social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit have played a major role in spreading awareness and interest in the cryptocurrency. They have provided a platform for users to discuss and share information about Bitcoin, and have helped to build a community of users and investors. Twitter, in particular, has become a key platform for discussions about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It has been used by individuals and organizations to share news, updates, and analysis about the cryptocurrency market. This has helped to build a strong community of users and investors who are interested in Bitcoin and other digital currencies. Social media has also been used to drive interest in initial coin offerings (ICOs) and other fundraising efforts related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Many startups and projects have used social media to promote their ICOs and attract investors.
Twitter sentiment analysis for determining the price of Bitcoin has become an important area of research in recent years, as it has the potential to provide valuable insights into the market sentiment of Bitcoin. The reason for this is that Twitter is a popular platform for discussing financial markets, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Therefore, by analyzing the sentiment of tweets related to Bitcoin, it is possible to gain a better understanding of how people feel about the cryptocurrency and how this sentiment might impact its price. Creating a data pipeline for Twitter sentiment analysis using Python is important because it allows for the efficient collection, preprocessing, and analysis of large amounts of data. Python is a popular programming language for data analysis, and it provides a wide range of libraries and frameworks that can be used to build a data pipeline.
One of the key advantages of using Python for building a data pipeline is its ability to handle large amounts of data. Python has powerful libraries like Pandas and NumPy that can be used to efficiently load, manipulate, and analyze large datasets. This makes it possible to quickly and easily collect large amounts of tweets and prepare them for analysis. Additionally, Python also has several libraries specifically designed for natural language processing (NLP) like NLTK, TextBlob, and Gensim, which can be used for text preprocessing, tokenization, and sentiment analysis. These libraries provide pre-built functions and models for common NLP tasks such as removing stop words, stemming and lemmatization, and analyzing the sentiment of text.
Another advantage of using Python for building a data pipeline is its ability to integrate with other technologies. Python can be integrated with databases like MySQL, MongoDB, and SQLite to store the collected data and also can be integrated with other languages like R, Java and Scala.

This project involves creating a data acquisition and preprocessing pipeline using python that will be used to extract tweets from twitter that have the keyword bitcoin and then performing data preparation on the obtained data in order to perform sentiment analysis on each tweet. The final results of the analysis will show whether most tweets express positive, negative or neutral views on bitcoin which can be used to help predict the price of bitcoin. This will be possible because if majority of the tweets analyzed have positive sentiments, then that means that people are positive about it and thus the price is likely to go up and if itâ€™s negative then people are not confident thus the price is likely to go down. For the neutral sentiments it means that people are neither positive nor negative thus the price is likely not fluctuate.
# Design of the pipeline
 The design of a Twitter sentiment analysis pipeline using Python for tweets about Bitcoin will involve several steps, including data acquisition, data preparation, data transformations, and sentiment analysis.
1.	Data Acquisition: The first step in the pipeline will be to acquire the data, which in this case will be tweets about Bitcoin. This can be done using the Twitter API, which allows developers to access tweets based on specific keywords or hashtags. The tweets can be collected by sending a request to the API, specifying the search criteria such as the keyword "Bitcoin" and the date range. 
2.	Data Preparation: After collecting the tweets, the next step will be to prepare the data for analysis. This will involve cleaning the tweets by removing any unwanted characters, URLs, and mentions. The tweets will also need to be tokenized, which involves breaking the tweets down into individual words or phrases. Additionally, any punctuations will need to be removed as they do not provide any useful information for sentiment analysis.
3.	Data Transformations: Once the tweets have been cleaned and tokenized, they will need to be transformed into a format that can be used for sentiment analysis. One common method for this is to convert the tweets into a numerical representation, such as a bag-of-words or a term-document matrix. This will be done using Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn.
4.	Sentiment Analysis: The final step in the pipeline will be to perform sentiment analysis on the tweets. This can be done using various techniques such as lexicon-based, rule-based, or machine learning-based methods. Sentiment analysis library VADER, NLTK and textblob will be used to perform sentiment analysis on the tweets. The output of this step will be a sentiment score of for each tweet indicating the sentiment of the tweet whether it is positive, negative or neutral.
# Description and documentation of the artifact
Like described in the requirements above, the data pipeline will be done using Python thus for this case the best case will be to use a jupyter notebook so that the steps are outlined using both code and markdowns to show the both the code and the output of the code followed by an explanation of what is happening. In order to document the artifact, a step-by-step breakdown of the jupyter notebook is outlined below;
The first step in the code is importing all the libraries that will be needed to perform different actions like connecting to twitter using Tweepy and extracting tweets and nltk for conducting sentiment analysis among many others.
 
In order to extract tweets about bitcoin from twitter using the twitter API, we need to be authenticated. This step involves first creating a twitter developer account and obtaining the bearer token that will make it possible for the Tweepy library to connect to tweeter and extract tweets based on the keyword supplied.
 
Now that we are connected the next step is to perform data collection or rather data extraction from twitter. This is done using Tweepy library. We supply the keyword as bitcoin.
  
The code shown above extracts the tweets from twitter using Tweepy and stores the data in an array and then conduct sentiment analysis on the unclean data.
The next step is to classify the results of the sentiment analysis done at this step.
 
From the results shown above, a total of 100 tweets were retrieved where positive are 47, negative are 21 and the neutral are 32. Based on this data we can visualize the sentiments so far.
 
The code produces a bar chart which visualizes the results for easier understanding.
 
We can now preview the retrieved tweets before performing data preparation.
 

We have now successfully performed the data extraction step and we can proceed to perform data preparation. This will first involve dropping any duplicates tweets. It is important to drop duplicates before conducting sentiment analysis on tweets for several reasons:
1.	Reducing Noise: Dropping duplicates helps to reduce noise in the data, which can lead to more accurate sentiment analysis results. If a tweet is duplicated, it would be counted multiple times in the analysis, which would skew the results.
2.	Saving Time and Space: Dropping duplicates can also save time and space when conducting sentiment analysis. If there are a large number of duplicates, it would take longer to analyze the data, and it would also take up more memory to store the duplicates.
3.	Improving Efficiency: Removing duplicates can also help to improve the efficiency of the sentiment analysis pipeline. When duplicates are removed, the pipeline can focus on analyzing the unique tweets rather than wasting time analyzing the same tweets multiple times.
4.	Reducing Bias: If a tweet is duplicated and its sentiment is positive, it will be counted multiple times as positive, leading to a bias towards positive sentiment, if its sentiment is negative, it will lead to a bias towards negative sentiment. Removing duplicates will make the sentiment analysis more accurate and unbiased.
To remove duplicate tweets, the following code is executed.
 
After dropping the duplicates, we can now see the new list of tweets.
 
The next step is to remove special characters, punctuations and any RT in the tweets.
 
Our data is now clean and we can start to perform sentiment analysis. 
 
A preview of the results of the sentiment analysis is shown below;
 

Based on the results shown above we can now perform basic statistics to show the percentage of each sentiment.
 

We can see after cleaning the data the percentage of neutral tweets rises thus we can use this information to plot a visualization using a chart.
